## 🔧 Step-by-Step Submission Process

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Check current status
git status
```

### Step 2: Verify .gitignore is Working

```bash
# Check that sensitive files are ignored
git status

# You should NOT see:
# - .env
# - venv/
# - *.csv
# - *.faiss
# - *.pkl
# - __pycache__/
```

### Step 3: Stage Files for Commit

```bash
# Add all files (respecting .gitignore)
git add .

# Verify what will be committed
git status
```

**Expected files to be committed:**
```
api.py
app.py
recommender.py
embedder.py
data_loader.py
data_crawler.py (optional)
generate_predictions.py
requirements.txt
README.md
.gitignore
env.example
IMPROVEMENTS.md
IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (optional)
verify_improvements.py (optional)
prepare_for_submission.py (optional)
SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md (optional)
GITHUB_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md (optional)
```

**Files that should NOT be committed (already in .gitignore):**
```
.env
venv/
__pycache__/
*.csv
*.faiss
*.pkl
shl_catalogue.xlsx (if large, consider adding to .gitignore)
```

### Step 4: Create Initial Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: SHL Assessment Recommendation System

- FastAPI backend with /health and /recommend endpoints
- Streamlit frontend with semantic search
- Gemini embeddings and FAISS vector store
- Data cleaning and embedding generation scripts
- Batch prediction generator
- Comprehensive documentation and error handling"
```

### Step 5: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `shl-assessment-recommendation-system` (or your preferred name)
5. Description: "Intelligent SHL Assessment Recommendation System using semantic search with Gemini embeddings"
6. Visibility: **Public** (for assignment submission)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 6: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v
```

### Step 7: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 8: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Verify all files are present
3. Check that sensitive files (`.env`, `venv/`, etc.) are NOT visible
4. Verify README.md displays correctly

## 📝 Important Notes

### About `shl_catalogue.xlsx`

- **Decision needed**: Should this file be included in the repository?
  - **Option 1**: Include it if it's small (<10MB) and needed to run the project
  - **Option 2**: Exclude it if it's large or contains proprietary data
    - Add to `.gitignore`: `shl_catalogue.xlsx`
    - Document in README that users need to provide their own catalog file

**Recommendation**: If the file is required for the project to work, include it. Otherwise, add it to `.gitignore` and document the requirement in README.

### About Generated Files

The following files are **generated** and should **NOT** be committed:
- `shl_catalog_cleaned.csv` - Generated by `data_loader.py`
- `shl_index.faiss` - Generated by `embedder.py`
- `shl_index.pkl` - Generated by `embedder.py`
- `predictions.csv` - Generated by `generate_predictions.py`

These are already in `.gitignore`, so they won't be committed.

### About Documentation Files

Optional documentation files (can be included or removed):
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Useful for tracking improvements
- `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation notes
- `verify_improvements.py` - Verification script (useful for testing)
- `prepare_for_submission.py` - Submission preparation script
- `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` - Checklist for submission
- `GITHUB_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md` - This file

**Recommendation**: Keep `IMPROVEMENTS.md` as it shows project evolution. Others are optional.

## 🔍 Final Verification

Before pushing, verify:

1. **No sensitive data**: Run `prepare_for_submission.py` to check
2. **All required files present**: Check `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`
3. **README is complete**: Verify installation and usage instructions
4. **.gitignore is working**: Check `git status` shows only intended files
5. **No large files**: Ensure no files >100MB (GitHub limit)
